Answer the following questions. For each, write in comments what the answer is followed by how you came to that conclusion:

If x equals 7, and the only other statement is x = x % 3, what would be the value of x after the calculation?
If y equals 21, and the only other statement is y = y % 4, what would be the value of y after the calculation?
If z equals 13, and the only other statement is z = z % 2, what would be the value of z after the calculation?
*/

// MY ANSWERS
/*
1- Value of x after calc. is 1.
2- Value of y after calc. is also 1.
3- Value of z after calc. is also 1.
*/

/* CODE
const x = 7;
x = x % 3;

console.log(x);

const y = 21;
y = y % 4;

console.log(y);

const z = 13;
z = z % 2;

console.log(z);
